# Tomography-assisted noisy quantum circuit simulator using matrix product density operators

###### I have to emphasize that this project is not intended for High Performance Computing now.

This work contains the code of paper "Tomography-assisted noisy quantum circuit simulator using matrix 
product density operators". This work simply combines the Quantum Process Tomography with Matrix Product 
Density Operators to simulate the quantum circuit with experimental "real noise". The manuscript can be 
found here: [https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.032604](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.110.032604).
## Computer Implementation

Main Packages Required:

- Pytorch >= 2.0
- TensorNetwork -- Latest Version

### TensorNetwork Package
###### Because of the design from old version PyTorch, You need to substitute the decompositions.py file in TensorNetwork.backend.torch to reach the correct SVD and QR decomposition.

The project centers around TensorNetwork, a mathematical methodology capable of performing truncation to
expedite calculations while maintaining a constrained level of error, a phenomenon introduced through Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD).

The chosen software tool employed for TensorNetwork calculations is the Python package named "TensorNetwork,"
accessible at [https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork](https://github.com/google/TensorNetwork). This package
boasts multiple backends, including Jax, Pytorch, Tensorflow, Numpy, and others. It is essential to note that,
as of the last update in 2021, the package is in an alpha version and no longer receives regular updates.
Within the context of this project, the PyTorch backend was adopted and configured accordingly.

```
tensornetwork.set_default_backend("pytorch")
```

### Qubit

A qubit serves as the fundamental unit in quantum computing, representing a two-level quantum system. In the
context of this project, I employ "tn.Node" or "tn.AbstractNode" as qubits, which can be dynamically adjusted
in
rank through contraction.

**Attention:** Axis_names is an important property in TensorNetwork Package, which is a list in python, it
easily makes mistakes. In this project, I have designed a general high-rank qubit/tensor representation for
the current model of quantum computing. The qubit/tensor structure is depicted in the picture below:

<p align="center">
<img src="./fig_md/qubit_axis.svg" width="320" />
</p>

Noticed that the indices name is explicit with number of qubit, for 1st qubit, it has name in pic.

### Quantum Gate

Quantum Gates are commonly defined as matrices; however, in tensornetwork, they are treated as tensors, which
represent a generalization of matrices. From a conceptual standpoint, a single-qubit gate like 'X' can be
represented as a 2x2 matrix, which corresponds to a (2, 2) rank-2 tensor. Similarly, a multi-qubit gate like '
CNOT' is typically represented as a 4x4 matrix, which can be equivalently represented as a (2, 2, 2, 2) rank-4
tensor.

I have developed a class named TensorGate() within the file basic_gate.py. This class includes fundamental
quantum gates, each possessing properties such as name, tensor, rank, shape, axis_names, and others.

**Attention:** Axis_names is an important property in TensorNetwork Package, which is a list in python, it
easily makes mistakes. I have designed the TensorGate() class to handle gates/tensors, as depicted in the
picture below. The class is readily extensible to accommodate many-qubit gates, providing a versatile and
scalable solution.

<p align="center">
<img src="./fig_md/gate_axis.svg" width="320" />
</p>

Currently, I provided basic gates
as: ['X', 'Y', 'Z', 'H', 'S', 'T', 'RX', 'RY', 'RZ', 'U1', 'U2',
'U3', 'U', 'CNOT', 'CZ', 'SWAP', 'RZZ']. Their tensor form is formed with
function
**torch.reshape()**, except CNOT, which tensor is derived from its truth table.

## Physics Implementation

Adding quantum gates to qubits is the basic operation in quantum computing, and it's naturally to be show
in tensornetwork form like picture below.

<p align="center">
<img src="./fig_md/gate_add_strategy.svg" width="800" />
</p>

Quantum entanglement between qubits stands as a pivotal aspect of quantum computing, primarily facilitated by
many-qubit gates. It bestows upon qubits/tensors an additional degree of freedom to coexist. Employing
tensornetwork to represent quantum circuits is primarily motivated by its efficient contraction strategy.
While observing the outcomes of a quantum circuit, one typically obtains a probability distribution rather
than an explicit series of nodes. Unfortunately, attempting to contract all operated nodes simultaneously can
lead to an exponential explosion of computational resources. To mitigate this issue, tensornetwork technique
offers various contraction algorithms, such as DMRG, which leverage the truncation feature of the SVD function
to accelerate calculations. Consequently, when implementing the addition of quantum gates, I have adopted a
strategy to limit the dimension of bonds between entangled qubits, thereby ensuring computational tractability
and enhancing the overall efficiency of the quantum circuit representation.

1. Do a local optimal approximation on inner indices by SVD, which is (this part
   is introduced
   by quantum noise, and I'll show it later).

```math
    T_{l_k, r_k}^{s_k, a_k} = \sum_\mu U^{s_k, \mu}_{l_k, r_k} S_\mu V_{\mu, a_k}
```

Keep $\kappa$ largest singular values $S_\mu$ after a layer of noise.

2. Apply QR-decomposition on each Tensor from left to right (which forms a
   canonical form of MPO),

```math
    T_{l_k, r_k}^{s_k, a_k} = \sum_\mu Q^{s_k, a_k}_{l_k, \mu} R_{\mu, r_k}
```

Except the rightest tensor, all other tensors got left-orthogonalized.

3. Apply SVD from right to left to truncate each of the bond indices,

```math
    \sum_ {l_ {k+1}} T_ {l_k, l_ {k+1}}^{s_k, a_k} T_ {l_ {k+1}, r_ {k+1}}^{s_ {k+1}, a_ {k+1}}\approx 
    \sum_ {\mu=1}^{\chi} U^{s_k, a_k}_ {l_k, \mu} S_\mu V_ {\mu, r_ {k+1}}^{s_ {k+1}, a_ {k+1}}
```

## Mathematical Implementation

Indeed, in traditional matrix operations, when applying a double-qubit gate to qubits that are non-adjacent (
stepping over other qubits), SWAP gates or permutation operations are typically required to control the matrix
elements appropriately.

However, in the context of tensornetwork, such extra steps are not necessary. This advantage arises because
the tensor representation of quantum gates operates within subspaces, each associated with "legs" that
correspond to qubits. By intelligently choosing the right legs to contract with the relevant qubits, it
becomes possible to perform the operation directly without any need for permutation or SWAP gates. This
streamlined approach is one of the key benefits of using tensornetwork to represent quantum circuits, as it
simplifies computations and minimizes the overhead typically associated with non-adjacent qubit interactions.

And the entanglement are naturally to be spread between qubits with following operations.

# Inplementation of Quantum Noise

</p>

## Unified Theoretical Noise Model

Quantum noise is a complex and essential aspect of quantum physics. Within the realm of quantum computation,
it can be categorized into various types or channels, two of which are amplitude damping and phase damping, as
illustrated in the diagram below:

<p align="center">
<img src="./fig_md/UnitedErrorModel.svg" width="1600" />
</p>

Amplitude damping refers to the loss of quantum information due to interactions with the environment, leading
to a decrease in the probability of the quantum state's amplitude. Phase damping, on the other hand, involves
the random introduction of phase errors, which alters the quantum state's phase information.

These quantum noise phenomena play a crucial role in the performance and reliability of quantum computations,
necessitating thorough understanding and mitigation strategies in quantum algorithms and quantum error
correction techniques.

Indeed, detailed quantum noise simulation and various noise channels can be found in books and research papers
on quantum computing and quantum information, such as "Quantum Computation and Quantum Information" (QCQI) by
Nielsen and Chuang. The implementation of quantum noise in quantum circuits often involves considering various
noise models and applying appropriate noise channels to simulate realistic quantum systems. The Actual circuit
in the picture likely represents a specific quantum circuit with quantum noise included, where some noise
channels are applied to the qubits.

Moreover, it is true that accounting for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors can be more
challenging, as they are typically associated with lower probabilities. In practice, researchers often focus
on the dominant noise sources and their impact on the quantum computation, while accounting for SPAM errors
when necessary.

## Real Noise (based on Experimental Data - $\chi$ Matrix)

A **TRUE** quantum noise simulation function with the QPT-Chi matrix on **REAL**
quantum
computer CZ-gate is provided. A real quantum noise takes places in actual
physical
control of the superconducting qubits, two examples are shown in picture below,
